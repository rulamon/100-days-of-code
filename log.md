# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp's introduction to JavaScript .

**Thoughts** Javascript is a lot harder to grasp than HTML, I like how the more abstract nature of it challenges me more.

### Day 2: October 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed a large portion of the FreeCodeCamp's introduction to Javascript, since I had already forgotten a large part.

**Thoughts** I'm getting a better feeling for the basics now.

### Day 3: October 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued the FreeCodeCamp's introduction to Javascript, starting with switch statements and doing part of the object-exercises.

**Thoughts** I still need to concentrate very much to get a good grip on what I'm doing. I had a very busy day so doing this in the evening when I'm tired doesn't help, but the concept of just working for one hour regardless of my progress is a very reassuring one, giving me a sense of accomplishment.

### Day 4: October 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the object exercises on FCC's introdution to JS, including the Record Collection function.

**Thoughts** After a very stressful day at my job it's relaxing to concentrate on the code, also with the idea that this will help me find a better job in time.

### Day 5: October 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC basic JS.

**Thoughts** Good work for two hours. Maybe more tonight.

### Day 6: October 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did some FCC exercises on ES6, not very much since it was hard to concentrate

**Thoughts** Too tired to concentrate deeply enough, brain won't work.

### Day 7: November 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did some more FCC exercises on ES6, but still hard to focus. Decided to practice and review some concepts from basic JS. 

**Thoughts** When it's hard to concentrate on new concepts, it's a better idea to build stuff to make my skills stronger.

### Day 8: November 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I could focus on the ES6 exercises and made some good progress.

**Thoughts** It's great to be able to make some progress and to focus!

### Day 9, 10, 11: November 3-5, Saturday - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Good progress in CodeAcademy's JavaScript tutorial, good to review concepts with a different explanation.

**Thoughts** It's nice to view concepts for the first time on FCC and then on CodeAcademy, this way I've already tried to understand the concepts through my own reasoning before actually getting a solid explanation. It requires more concentration, but makes me use my brain.

### Day 12: November 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: continued CodeAcademy's JavaScript tutorial

**Thoughts** A lot of work to do and a lot of info to process. I should do some exercises to consolidate what I learned.

### Day 13: November 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: learned Git basics (using it to update this log), finished FCC's ES6 section and started on regular expressions.

**Thoughts** Using git to update my log and for projects is a good way to get familiar with it.

### Day 14: November 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: almost finished regular expressions on FCC

### Day 15, day 16: November 10 and 11, Saturday and Sunday

**Today's Progress**: finished regex in FCC, started and finished debugging and basic data structures on FCC

**Thoughts** Making good progress, also in logical thinking

### Day 17: November 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started FCC's basic algorithm scripting

**Thoughts** It's nice to start solving problems with what I've learned so far, the solutions in the hint section help a lot too, I could always come up with a solution that worked, but the solutions provided were usually more efficient

### Day 18: November 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: continued basic algorithm scripting and made a repository of every exercise, working in sublime and committing and pushing to github on the command line

### Day 19: November 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: did three exercises

**Thoughts**: I should review the last one tomorrow, can't concentrate anymore but there are a lot of ways to do this, let's find which one I like best when I'm fresh
