# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp's introduction to JavaScript .

**Thoughts** Javascript is a lot harder to grasp than HTML, I like how the more abstract nature of it challenges me more.

### Day 2: October 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed a large portion of the FreeCodeCamp's introduction to Javascript, since I had already forgotten a large part.

**Thoughts** I'm getting a better feeling for the basics now.

### Day 3: October 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued the FreeCodeCamp's introduction to Javascript, starting with switch statements and doing part of the object-exercises.

**Thoughts** I still need to concentrate very much to get a good grip on what I'm doing. I had a very busy day so doing this in the evening when I'm tired doesn't help, but the concept of just working for one hour regardless of my progress is a very reassuring one, giving me a sense of accomplishment.

### Day 4: October 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the object exercises on FCC's introdution to JS, including the Record Collection function.

**Thoughts** After a very stressful day at my job it's relaxing to concentrate on the code, also with the idea that this will help me find a better job in time.

### Day 6: October 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did some FCC exercises on ES6, not very much since it was hard to concentrate

**Thoughts** Too tired to concentrate deeply enough, brain won't work.

### Day 7: November 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did some more FCC exercises on ES6, but still hard to focus. Decided to practice and review some concepts from basic JS. 

**Thoughts** When it's hard to concentrate on new concepts, it's a better idea to build stuff to make my skills stronger.

### Day 8: November 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I could focus on the ES6 exercises and made some good progress.
